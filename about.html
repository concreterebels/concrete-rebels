    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
        Concrete Rebels was born from cold nights, worn-out shoes, and the unshakable belief that self-expression matters.
        
        We don't just sell clothing — we capture the untold stories of the streets. Every design reflects the grind, the rebellion, the spirit of those who hustle when no one's watching, and those who don't ask for permission to be themselves.
        
        While the mainstream floods the world with predictable, polished fashion — we lace our threads with grit, attitude, and a rebel heart.
        
        Concrete Rebels is for the misunderstood, the overlooked, and the bold. Whether you're wandering neon-soaked alleys at midnight or catching first light on the city rooftops — you're one of us.
        
        This isn't just streetwear. This is armor for outsiders.
